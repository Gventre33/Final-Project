About my Dashboard:
My Dashboard allows users to explore historical data related to the National Football League (NFL). This Dashboard presents two graphics and a number of widgets in which to flexibly explore each graphic.

The first graphic is a datatable that presents the overall standings of every team in the NFL in a given year. This graphic can be modified by filtering by different conferences within the NFL (AFC and NFC) and by different divisions within those respective conferences (North, East, South, West). The graphic can also be modified by the year select slider.

The second graphic is a scatterplot that can be interacted with by all the widgets. Those that are specific to this graphic are the team select dropdown, x_axis select dropdown and y_axis select dropdown, which modify the respective axes as well as the teams that are shown on the graph.

This Dashboard was built out of my own recent interest in the NFL and I felt it would be a helpful tool when analyzing historical data on the NFL all in one place. I think this tool could be used by both NFL analysts and casual fans alike.


Building Process:
The building process involved some cleaning of the initial data as well as cleaning throughout the process as my requirements evolved.
